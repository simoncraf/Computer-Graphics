LAB 2 - SIMONE GIGANTE GASSO 

All the exercises work just as the statement asks.
To change the mode you have to use the numbers (from 1 to 5):

1 - DDA Lines
2 - Bresenham Lines
3 - Bresenham Circle
4 - Triangle
5 - Interpolated triangle

Pressing the F key fills or empties the figures (only the last one that has just been drawn and the future ones).
Pressing the R key deletes all the drawings.
Pressing D we undo the last figure, although for now it fails with the triangle not interpolated because of how I'm saving the states.
With the space bar we change the color with which we draw.
With the key I we change the colors for the interpolation.
